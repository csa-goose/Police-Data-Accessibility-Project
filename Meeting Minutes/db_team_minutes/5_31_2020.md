4. Roles and responsibility

5. What does an MVP look like?

    publicly available, free of charge."

6. Funding

7. Technology

    Cloud hosting
    Tools (db, etl, orchestration, etc)


#### Contd...

What do we want to store, what do we think should be shared?

Need to be cognizant of what and how we are storing from a legal perspective in regards to our 501c3/4.

Raw data lake with unprocessed data will have limited access. Curated data without PII should be abstracted before allowing public consumption.


Personas?
* seeking raw data
* seeking visuals, a curated story
* May need to define personas more clearly

If records are updated, how do we account for that in the data sets?
* What if a record is updated? What if the update changes the outcome of the case?

Nick: update and sync seems important in his purview.

Seems premature to discuss roles and respon. at this time.

Meeting logistics: Nothing formalized yet. Zoom is $15 per mo. for meetings over 40 min.

Google meet? Gmail business?
